                        <p>I'm Gaia - my career started in people operations, and currently I'm the people partner for product & engineering teams at Ably. <br> <br> My day to day work consists of catching up with our product & engineering team members to get an understanding of how their time at Ably is going, partnering with team leads & enabling them to successfully manage their teams, and employee lifecycle events - from onboarding through to offboarding. I also have the opportunity to take on projects, like updating our parental leave policy, and (my favorite) nerding out in complex Google Sheets whenever possible. <br> <br> When I'm not working on Ably things, I love getting stuck into various hobbies - from creative writing, to embroidery, to making pizza from scratch, and recently I've started learning to code. Which is why this page exists. :D <br> </p>

                            As part of my work at Ably, I lead a refresh of our parental leave policy, to make it more generous, more inclusive, and more compassionate.
