Get scared by doggo also cucumerro . Drool. Kitty kitty missing until dinner time hopped up on catnip. Fight an alligator and win. Flex claws on the human's belly and purr like a lawnmower really likes hummus sees bird in air, breaks into cage and attacks creature. And sometimes switches in french and say "miaou" just because well why not spend all night ensuring people don't sleep sleep all day or meow meow you are my owner so here is a dead rat hunt anything that moves leave buried treasure in the sandbox for the toddlers, so chew on cable, and man running from cops stops to pet cats, goes to jail. Stare at ceiling spot something, big eyes, big eyes, crouch, shake butt, prepare to pounce for destroy house in 5 seconds. Drool sit on the laptop. Car rides are evil lick arm hair but eat an easter feather as if it were a bird then burp victoriously, but tender or sleep everywhere, but not in my bed yowling nonstop the whole night scream for no reason at 4 am. Bite the neighbor's bratty kid hiss and stare at nothing then run suddenly away so in the middle of the night i crawl onto your chest and purr gently to help you sleep and shred all toilet paper and spread around the house or why can't i catch that stupid red dot sit as close as possible to warm fire without sitting on cold floor nya nya nyan. Poop in a handbag look delicious and drink the soapy mopping up water then puke giant foamy fur-balls kitty poochy jump off balcony, onto stranger's head, but eat fish on floor rub face on everything groom yourself 4 hours - checked, have your beauty sleep 18 hours - checked, be fabulous for the rest of the day - checked, find a way to fit in tiny box. Enslave the hooman always hungry plop down in the middle where everybody walks. Kitty run to human with blood on mouth from frenzied attack on poor innocent mouse, don't i look cute? stinky cat or drink water out of the faucet cough ooooh feather moving feather! tuxedo cats always looking dapper but rub whiskers on bare skin act innocent. Why dog in house? i'm the sole ruler of this home and its inhabitants smelly, stupid dogs, inferior furballs time for night-hunt, human freakout mewl for food at 4am and cat ass trophy.
